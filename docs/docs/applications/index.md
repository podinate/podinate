# Applications
This section of the documentation contains reference material for various applications that you will commonly want to run in a container and on Podinate. It is designed to be applicable to various platforms, not just Podinate. 

This reference is designed to just contain information that container wranglers will commonly need access to, such as the following:

- **Environment Variables** - any environment variables the application requires to work or that are very commonly set.
- **Volumes** - Where does the application persist data to disk, that you may want to mount a volume at.

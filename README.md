# podinate
Podinate is a management tool for your Kubernetes cluster, inspired by IaC tools. It works with a simple HCL-based language or using your existing YAML. It will tell you exactly what it will do before it does it. Perfect if you're just learning the Kube!

## Features
- **Simple Deployment** - if you're just trying to deploy a basic app you've written, Podinate can get it running in just a few minutes.
- **Powered by Kubernetes** - Podinate makes Kubernetes easy to use by removing the need to remember exact YAML syntax. 
- **Gentle Learning Curve** - Podinate is designed to be familiar for anyone who's used to working with Docker Compose. 

## Getting Started
To get started with Podinate, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation** Install a local Kubernetes cluster and deploy an app by following our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.podinate.com/getting-started/quick-start/)
2. **Configure Your App** Podinate uses HCL to define Pods to deploy, or it can work directly with your existing YAML (coming soon).
3. **Deploy Anywhere** Podinate can be used to deploy your configuration anywhere Kubernetes can run (hint: that's anywhere). You can start with developing on your laptop, deploy to a simple cloud virtual machine, and scale to an entire EKS setup. 

## Installing
Check out the [Quick Start](https://docs.podinate.com/getting-started/quick-start/) for installation instructions.
